Leverage exaggerates both the ups and the downs. 

Risky in investments because 
some larger than expected downside
can result in you losing everything
or not being able to easily recover. 

Loss percentages are asymmetric.

Technology is also a lever. 
Optimistically, 
it can make a lot of things
more efficient, etc.

But it may grow too fast
for people to fully adapt to. 
We've evolutionally adapted to 
small, slow changes across time. 

Although you may not be able to stop productivity, 
you can at least not participate in it. 

There may be some things worth participating on though. 
Some things are must haves that if we don't solve 
by a certain period of time, we'll never be able to. 

Global warming may be one of those problems. 
It's one of those things that if we could have successfully completed tomorrow, 
we'd probably wouldn't regret.
