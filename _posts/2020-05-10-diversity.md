From supermarkets to artists and musicians, 
there are so many things good and bad;
so many different styles and admirers.

They may have no choice 
but to do what makes sense to them.
Maybe others are also interested 
in their creations.

I read a lot online. 
When I come across people's blogs
or social media, 
I checkout a sampling of their work
and sometimes subscribe 
(one of my [experiments](/experiment)).

Going through someone's 
journal/thoughts/writing/work
across years is really interesting. 
It's part of why I love biographies;
better than in a lot of fiction,
I can immerse myself into their life
and world. 
I can put myself in their shoes 
at a particular point in time
as they think through problems,
sometimes solving,
and sometimes failing.
These are real people,
making real-life decisions,
with real consequencies. 
You can fast forward
or rewind 
and see what happens. 
You may be able to learn something 
from them. 

There's an incredibly diverse amount of content
out there,
this bliki included 
(but unfortunately,
it's harder to see things across time
unless you dig into [the commit history](https://github.com/dijonkitchen/dijonkitchen.github.io/commits/master)). 
You can't read it all,
even if it'd be really interesting. 

This expanse of diversity 
can be overwhelming. 
Or you can embrace the [freedom](/freedom).
Perhaps [explore](/exploration) the cutting edge 
for easier problems others aren't looking at yet. 
No more unique a cutting edge than 
the intersection of disciplines. 

collaboration to expand outreach

regular creations for mindshare
