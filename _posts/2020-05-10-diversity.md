I read a lot online. 

When I come across people's blogs
or social media, 
I checkout a sampling of their work
and sometimes subscribe 
(one of my [experiments](/experiment)).

Going through someone's 
journal/thoughts/writing/work
across years is really interesting. 
It's part of why I love biographies;
better than in a lot of fiction,
I can immerse myself into their life
and world. 
I can put myself in their shoes 
as they think through problems,
sometimes solving,
and sometimes failing.
These are real people,
making real-life decisions,
with real consequencies. 
You may be able to learn something 
from them. 

There's an incredibly diverse amount of content
out there,
this bliki included. 
You can't read it all,
even if it'd be really interesting. 
Take some time to explore it,
and open your mind,
but don't only [explore](/exploration).
