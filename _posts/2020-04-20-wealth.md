long-term creative freedom vs status; game theory

compounds itself 24/7

equity is your accountability and consistent brand/integrity

band together with those on the same journey; good character naturally grows network with your own input

asymmetric input vs output; high positive optionality

everyone's unique and provides some unique combination of skills that can help others like them

utilize the frontier since few people know where that is or how to master it

capitalism doesn't have to be oppression by those with money/power/fame 
if you understand it's an efficient means of communication 
and stick with those that want long-term creative freedom (possibly a positive sum for everyone), 
not status (zero sum; can't grow)

Productize yourself for product/market/founder fit. 
Be a creative. 

Don't need to take over the world.
There's room in the world 
for a [diverse](/diversity) number of businesses.
Many big businesses doing the same thing; 
even more smaller businesses doing something similar, 
but unique in specialization or localization.
