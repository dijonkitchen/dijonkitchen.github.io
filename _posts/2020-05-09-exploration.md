Seek to standardize on benchmarks to make decisions easier
if they are meaningful quantitative measures. 

Decide on a handful
of quality candidates

Move on after a few "strike outs",
but forgive after some time. 

Keep optionality

May even be best 
to leave decisions to chance (50/50 coin flip)
to save time
if easy to undo.
Example: hire quickly, fire quickly.
Note externalities.

Optimize for lean feedback cycle
of learning,
then stop, 
and adapt,
and iterate. 

Inherantly scientific
and human nature 
to reach for the stars (Star Trek).

Minimize long-term catatrospic loss,
but be a reasonable optimist.
