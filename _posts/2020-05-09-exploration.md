Seek to standardize on benchmarks to make decisions easier
if they are meaningful quantitative measures. 

Decide on a handful
of quality candidates

Keep optionality

May even be best 
to leave decisions to chance (50/50 coin flip)
to save time
if easy to undo.
Example: hire quickly, fire quickly.
Note externalities.

Optimize for lean feedback cycle
of learning,
then stop, 
and iterate. 

Inherantly scientific
and human nature 
to reach for the stars (Star Trek).
