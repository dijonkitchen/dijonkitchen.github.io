People think we're so different than other animals, 
but we all have the same motivations to survive, 
extend our genes, 
and persuade others of our beliefs. 
Humans can control their environment, 
but that just helps them with their fundamental desires. 

We need to think about if we want to adhere to our built-in, 
biological motivations or somehow rise above them, 
if possible. 

If we encounter any aliens, 
they'll likely have the same motivations to have survived and adapated to reach us.
