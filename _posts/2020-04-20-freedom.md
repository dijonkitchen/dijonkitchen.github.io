long-term creative freedom vs status; game theory

compounds itself 24/7

equity is your accountability and consistent brand/integrity

band together with those on the same journey; good character naturally grows network with your own input

asymmetric input vs output; high positive optionality

everyone's unique and provides some unique combination of skills that can help others like them

utilize the frontier since few people know where that is or how to master it

capitalism doesn't have to be oppression by those with money/power/fame 
if you understand it's an efficient means of communication 
and stick with those that want long-term creative freedom (possibly a positive sum for everyone), 
not status (zero sum; can't grow)

Productize yourself for product/market/founder fit. 
Be a creative. 

Don't need to take over the world.
There's room in the world 
for a [diverse](/diversity) number of businesses.
Many big businesses doing the same thing; 
even more smaller businesses doing something similar, 
but unique in specialization or localization. 
Even with exactly the same business,
this offers the world some resiliency 
in the services or products
that are offered. 

In the end,
it's about freedom 
to do what you want
when you want it. 
Freedom to create
your ideal future
and actualize your dreams.
Work for others
or work for yourself,
it's up to you.  

VCs/Startups working together
to accelerate the future
as the Research and Development
of the world.
Ideally, the future should be
much better than today. 
Small chance of accelerating to 
[a future we can't control](https://80000hours.org/topic/priority-paths/technical-ai-safety/)
that dooms us all. 

Read quality books to learn about the past,
pursue possibly foolish fun things in the present,
be generous and create your ideal future.
