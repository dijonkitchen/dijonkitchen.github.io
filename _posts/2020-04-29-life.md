Life aspirations 
thinking about a child,
but can really be applied to anyone.

Autodidactic unschooling 
with mastery learning 
of foundational principles
- Reading a ton of books across genres/subjects
- Creative jazz/art
- Math/Statistis/Physics/Computer science/Engineering
- Logic/Philosophy/Rhetoric/Persuation
- Psychology/Economics
- Terrestrial and extraterrestrial travel
- Multilingual (English/Chinese/Latin/Spanish/French/German/Hindi/Arabic/Esperanto)

Fitness
- Decathlete/triathlete/bouldering/parkour
- Team sports leader
- Adventurer

Advancing the state of the art 
with explorative,
collaborative entrepreneurship 
of sustainable businesses for freedom
- Failing, but not catastrophically failing, and recovering along the way
- Building community of life partners along the way that question them and keep them on their toes

Civic duty 
to enhance the long-term
for all walks of life 
in a global commonwealth 
as an empathetic military/political leader
and rational optimist

Great legacy from 
integrity, 
hard work, 
and 
critical thinking

Definitely spread your genes if you've done this
