Watching and learning since 2011,
along with each wave. 

More incentive to support blockchain and profit
with majority ownership
than to ruin it for the minority. 
Especially when proofs are expensive (compute, space, time).

Adaptive compute for a changing world collective. 
Correct wrongs with delegated consensus. 
Crypto internet computer
blockchain machine learning with all the auditable, anonymous data and compute.

Iterate toward global governance bootstrapping (Yunah)
Aligning influence and ownership
Coordinated effort to slow/reverse adverse climate change

Decentralized, aligned cities/countries/economy
Democratization of power/influence

Can't stop distributed ideas and people,
especially the younger future.
Anyone can participate.

Fragmentation risk with blockchain overload
Multi-currency interoperation (virtual and physical)

Store of value is small usecase. 
Still fiat trust in core developers and risk of bugs or collusion. 
Open source allows anyone to audit, but also very difficult given technical complexity. 

Maximum value something greater than global GDP
with additional attributed to 
added opportunities, 
efficiency, 
volume, 
and postive feedback loop.
