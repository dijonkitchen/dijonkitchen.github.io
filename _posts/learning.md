## Learning how to learn

Deliberate focus
building mental models 
(chunky trunk of principles) 
to grow 
leaves of creativity. 
Mastery learning 
frees up limited working memory
of four chunks
for other thoughts 
or connections.
Don't overlearn
things you have already mastered.
Otherwise, 
you'll only be confirming
your own beliefs/methods/existing knowledge
rather than exploring 
new information
and possibility
learning
something new.
Collaboration with a team
helps spark new ideas and connections
which are deeper too. 
Practice multi-sensory association (memes!)
and recall
and good habits
to stay focused.
Plan ahead 
for avoiding bad habits.

Deliberate rest
to remember long-term, 
especially after many repetitions 
and struggles. 
Physical activity helps too.
Approach difficult things first
then come back to them later
for new perspectives
after some diffuse processing.

These discoveries 
seem similar 
to how babies learn.
They are constantly
moving all over the place,
observing 
even the tiniest details
in a multi-sensory way,
focused on them,
then something else,
then tired, 
they must rest and process them.
They're obviously
learning a lot very quickly
between various motor skills,
language,
and so many things
we take for granted.
Understand that it's a normal process
not a product. 
Focus on output
and outcomes will come.


## Growth versus fixed mindset

A growth mindset 
is basically 
having the attitude that failing is acceptable 
because you can learn from failures
going forward. 
You experiment 
with new things
and may fail 
once in a while,
but what you learn from it compounds
and keeps encouraging you to do even more.

Fixed mindsets 
are the opposite. 
You restrict yourself 
from trying new things
because you may fail.
And because 
the world keeps changing, 
with new people 
learning new things, 
you essentially 
get left behind 
by not adapting.

I first heard about
a growth versus fixed mindset
while reviewing some algebra lessons
on Khan Academy 
with my girlfriend. 
Sal Khan, 
the founder,
had an article
talking about a growth mindset
and why he would only praise his son
for effort
rather than results
because that would encourage
a growth mindset. 
This made a lot of sense to me
and I was interested 
to hear that it is also a superset 
(and I love supersets!) 
of grit 
and some other character traits 
that I've read about from 
KIPP. 
Of course 
I dug a little deeper 
to learn about
growth mindsets 
and found a TED Talk
about it too.

It's interesting 
that this attitude 
in a growth mindset 
is also related to the
Lean software development
philosophy of 
"Think big, act small, fail fast, learn rapidly." 
I'll get to that another day.
