Information 
and disinformation (aka fake news, pseudoscience, etc.) 
is rampant online.

Although search engines and reputable sites help,
there's just too much out there for people to filter. 

There are likely 
only a few people 
with enough foresight and discipline 
to [stave of social media and notifications](https://humanetech.com/resources/take-control/)
to focus on long-term projects or those of others, like books. 

Using something like 
[StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji)
could help if you whitelist only a few good, reputable sites. 
Even better would be if those were the default for first-time installers. 

Stay creative, stay smart.
