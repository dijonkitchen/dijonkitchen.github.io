title: "Why I Chose a Jekyll Blog on GitHub Pages"
---

While researching how to make a website, I looked at a lot of possibilities. There's the easy way of just using an established platform like Wordpress, Medium, or Blogger... but where's the fun in that?! The whole point of me making a website was to learn and practice new skills in HTML, CSS, and maybe a bit of Javascript too!

First, I needed to cover the basics of mobile-first and responsiveness. All the platforms had this, but how was I going to do it in an efficient time frame? Just searching online, I found out that GitHub has GitHub Pages which would essentially host a website for you for free! This seemed a lot better than paying money every month and go through a whole process of setting everything up and making sure it works. Don't get me wrong, this is interesting, but not my current goal. I don't want to have to worry about configurations and bandwidth and if I'm paying enough so that if a million people visit my site, from all over the world, with all sorts of devices, that they'll be able to see all my content properly.

The best thing I found that catered to all these needs was forking a GitHub repository. I had heard of GitHub while doing programming language research and this seemed like a great place to host my website. They were a knowledgeable organization that would also be very friendly to programmers! I knew that I wouldn't have my own domain name unless I paid for it, but I didn't mind; associating myself with a great company that programmers use all the time seemed like a win/win situation.

I hope you enjoy the new website. It's still a work in progress, as every site is, but I'll be continually adding improvements and new content as I learn more.
