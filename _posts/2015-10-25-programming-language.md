Difficulty -> Ease
Low-level languages -> high-level languages
Less people -> More people
Less conducive to early stage company -> more

High impact for all downstream value vs less, but more specific need

Developer experience:

Ease of understanding foreign code:
Dynamic type vs staticly typed

Once one language has critical mass, 
it overgrows others 
from momentum ecosystem network effects (tooling, docs, examples, open-source help).
It's irrespective of pros/cons.
Most non-tech companies don't know enough to make good tech decisions,
so they go with the flow.

Beware what net effects occur because of all this:
Work as low-level and difficult as possible,
if you worry about competition and job security
but you may be lonely at edges. 
Can only go the other way. 

Maybe it all nets out. 
The ups and downs may just almost even out. 
Do what you think is good 
and see where that leads you.
