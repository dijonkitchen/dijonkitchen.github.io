Risks are large, long-term losses.
Avoid catastrophes
and you can be optimistic
about your decision making
and make high-potential choices
even if they are low probability.
This minimizes regret
and can allow for a more fulfiling life.
You never know how short your life may be
and you may only be able to estimate
what may happen in the next 20 years or so.

Most things are sold versus bought.
Makes sense
that it's too much of a burden
for most people
to figure out what is the optimal thing
for themselves.
Heuristics like whatever they've seen popularly in advertising/marketing
is fine most of the time for non-critical things.

But for important, critical things,
think for yourself.
What can you do better
and/or differently
than others
that may help move towards
more discovery
of meaning.

Can you think or act
longer-term
than others?
Can you avoid catastrophe
to pursue,
potentially,
the best outcomes/ideals
for the future
or leave a legacy that does?
