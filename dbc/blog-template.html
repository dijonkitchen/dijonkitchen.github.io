How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

This was a fairly simple task since we created wireframes before for a previous challenge. Implementing it in HTML wasn't very hard since our website were very simple and no styling is required at this point.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Wireframing is helpful when you're trying to figure out the layout for a webpage.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

The basics of our wireframes were the same, a header on the top, a footer on the bottom, a blog post in the middle. We only differed with regards to where the navigation to other parts of the site were placed. He opted to do it on the top and mine was on the left side.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

The main semantic elements utilized were header, nav, section, and footer which we already learned in previous challenges.
