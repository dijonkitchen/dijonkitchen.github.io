            <p>
              While thinking about my move into technology and learning programming, I researched programming languages a lot! One of the major reasons for this was because I looked into concurrency.

            <p>
              One of the hardest things about being a developer is setting up your developer environment. Installing everything and making sure it works is tough. That's why I'm going to compeletely bypass that and move to hotkeys.

              Having used Ruby for the past three weeks, it's been a little tough moving to Javascript ('JS'). There was a sort of elegance about Ruby's syntax that allowed it to be very readable and flexible to however you wanted to approach a problem.

              Stereotype threat is the topic of this week's DBC cultural discussion. Stereotype threat is how someone's performance is affected by stereotypes that they may classify themselves under. The "threat" part is the underperformance due to negative stereotypes, but overperformance from positive stereotypes are possible under stereotype lift.

            <p>
              An interesting thing about object-oriented programming is that everything is an object and objects inherit characteristics from their parents and pass them on to their children. By organizing a set of objects this way, you can classify similar objects as well.

            <h3><a href="enumerable-methods.html">Enumer-whats?</a></h3>
            <p>
              Enumerables! It means that you're able to count something one at a time. They're sometimes referred as Ruby's most useful module (a bunch of methods packaged together)! Arrays and hashes are really powerful, but more so because of they can get mixed in with Enumerable methods. This adheres to the DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself") principle; once methods are incluced in Enumberable and included in Array and Hash classes, you can use those methods whenever you use collections (arrays and hashes)!

              Edward Snowden said that encryption was one of the easiest ways to protect your data. It deters theives from stealing your data but you need to do it correctly.

            <p>
              As I've been learning how to make webpages, I've been required to utilize HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the fundamental building blocks of a website. The idea is that the HTML provides all the content and the CSS provides all the styling.
