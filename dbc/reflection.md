### What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that you need a good spatial grasp of where the elements in the DOM are placed and then alter the padding, border, or margins.

### What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS positioning is really tricky when you have a lot of elements on a page. It's better to keep it simple as you start out. Also, if you utilize the mobile-first methodology and design for smaller screens in mind first, then it's easier to scale up than the other way around.

### What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Simple formatting of text, colors, and blocks was not that hard. Positioning was significantly more difficult. I was only able to make my website look good on small, mobile screens for now; it'll take some time to do media queries to make it more responsive and not look huge on a larger screen.

### What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I stuck with using the Atomic CSS methodology of single formatting changes per class. This helped it become more modular when I wanted to make changes, but you do sacrifice some cleanliness in the HTML.
