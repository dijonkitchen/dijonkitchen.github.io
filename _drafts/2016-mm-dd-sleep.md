title: "Sleep, community, health, happiness, wealth"

Eat and cleanup before sundown,
Walk and talk after,
Sleep,
Wake at sunrise,
Productively use daylight,
Repeat.

Healthy eating before late hours,
Exercise with walking,
Community and happiness with connection and talking,
Ample sleep with suncycle,
Drive to allocate time well.
