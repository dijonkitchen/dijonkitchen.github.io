People should be adjusting their beliefs slowly with bayesian reasoning, so you can't just change their mind in one encounter unless there is something significant. 

Not much reason to bash your own beliefs into your own head without making much of a difference to others unless it scale your own effort. Writing is one means of accomplishing this. You need only write once and let others read, reread, and digest it. Overtime, you'll get much more out of clearly delineating your thoughts once in the written word than casually talking about it many times with different people. You can always refine what you've written to include the strongest arguments. 

Thus I write. Perchance, I'll attract others that respect this kind of reasoning.
