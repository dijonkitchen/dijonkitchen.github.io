I'm going to set positive, specific goals to get better with a set timeline. Usually, I'm pretty good about always improving, but I don't usually set a timeline to say I should get this done by this time. Sometimes my goals are also more negative, such as I shouldn't do this or that, instead of rewording it to be something more positive.
