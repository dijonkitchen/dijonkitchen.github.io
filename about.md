Keeping in touch with memories using the autobiography tools of the future (blogs)!

Writing helps organize your thoughts in a clear way for your own memories as well as to aid others. This blog will help with that along with random musings longer than 140 characters.

Cyborg memory is better than the human brain, so this tracks my progress learning and utilizing the best tech I can understand. Hopefully it's helpful to some of you too.

Anything you can (or would want to) learn about me can be found via my social media links and in some blog posts on my [history](/history-1). Feel free to follow me!
